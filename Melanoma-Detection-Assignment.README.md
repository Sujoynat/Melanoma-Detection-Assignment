## General Information

## The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

The data set contains the following diseases:

Actinic keratosis
Basal cell carcinoma
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented benign keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis
Squamous cell carcinoma
Vascular lesion

## Technologies Used
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* Augmentor 

## Conclusions

* The final model used the Augmentor library to artificially generate enough samples to come up with  model that can detect a correct cancer type with a validation accuracy around 84%.
* The validation loss for the final model was 0.56
